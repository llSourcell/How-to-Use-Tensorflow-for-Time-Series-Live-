# How-to-Use-Tensorflow-for-Time-Series-Live

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/ftMq5ps503w) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. 
We use a [Recurrent neural network](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/) 
to learn the mapping between two binary sequences. We'll learn how memory operates in a recurrent net in this notebook.

## Dependencies

* tensorflow
* matplotlib
* numpy

install dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

Run this using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). 
Just type `jupyter notebook` in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window. 

## Credits

Credits go to [3h4](https://github.com/3h4). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
